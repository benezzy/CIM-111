    <p>This text has a <span id="span-tag">span tag</span> in it. The span tag is how you <span class="backgroundChange" id="span-tag">style</span> in-line with text (a particular piece of it).</p>

    <div id="box">
      <p>There is important information located inside this box. Everything inside this box is constrained to the dimensions of the box. It is aligned to the center, because that is one of the style attributes that I applied in the stylesheet. Padding allows me to set the marigns on the box, but it adds pixels to do this. So, I made the dimensions of the box 20 less, so that the padding didn't change the size of the box that I wanted originally.</p>
