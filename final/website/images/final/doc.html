        <p>Footprints is a University of Miami School of Communication Original Short Documentary created by several SoC students. It follows the elusive Florida Skunk Ape and those who believe in its existence in the Big Cypress National Preserve, part of the US National Parks System that borders the Florida Everglades. The Florida Skunk Ape is commonly referred to as the Florida version of Bigfoot due to similarities in description of the two and uncertainty in its existence. While the Skunk Ape is the primary focus of this film, it also touches on the acquisition of the preserve by the Florida government and the long term effects which included loss of income and homes to the local residents of Ochopee, FL.</p>
