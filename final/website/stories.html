        <h2 class="parhead">Recent Stories</h2>
        <p>My most recent story is a capstone journalism project for Television News Reporting, and it can be viewed above. I took an in-depth look at the origins of U-Pup, a University of Miami student organization devoted to the training of service dogs and the awareness of related issues. The story progresses from the organization's humble beginnings with one family and one special dog, and concludes with the current state of the organization and how it has affected both the members and the people who have received service animals.</p>
        <p>This semester, I have also done stories on the brand new intramural fields that will be coming to the Patti and Allan Herbert Wellness Center on the UM campus, a campus pep rally to celebrate/generate hype for the Miami-FSU football game, and on the creation of a concrete canoe by the UM chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, for racing in a nationwide competition.</p>
        <p>In the past, I have worked on a wide variety of stories. Some personal highlights include an in-depth look at living conditions inside a Tent City of homeless sex offenders near Hialeah, festivities at the Fourth of July Parade in Stockholm, ME, and a lesson in logging with students from Northern Maine Community College. I have worked on many more stories through my work at UMTV and WAGM-TV.</p>
