        <h2 class="parhead">My Articles</h2>
        <p>I have written a number of articles for various different outlets, including the University of Miami, WAGM-TV online, local newspapers in Caribou, Maine, as well as in several classes here at UM. The articles range in style, from event coverage to feature pieces to just fun storis that I found interesting.</p>
        <p>The links above feature some of my most recent articles. The first is an event I covered at the University of Miami law school. Leigh Steinberg, the sports agent who is the real life inspiration for Jerry Maguire, came to campus to speak to aspiring sports law professionals about his journey in sports.</p>
        <p>The next three articles all come from WAGM-TV, and are based on news stories that I produced as well. These include the renovation of a local basketball court organized by high school students, an exciting STEM-based summer camp for middle school students in Northern Maine, and a piece about safety while dirt-biking, riding ATVs, or otherwise using off-road vehicles in the trails.</p>
