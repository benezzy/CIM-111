          <p>I am a junior majoring in Broadcast Journalism and minoring in Sport Administration at the University of Miami. I am an active member of the university community, especially in UMTV, where I am the Assistant Station Manager, the Director of NewsVision, an Executive Producer of NewsBreak, and an Associate Producer of SportsDesk. I am also a member of the Presidents 100 Advisory Board, as the Special Events chair. I also work with WVUM Sports and I am an Intramural Supervisor on campus.</p>
          <p>I grew up in Caribou, Maine, a small town about 20 minutes away from Canada. I was the Corresponding Secretary for the National Honor Society, I was the Treasurer for the Class of 2016, I played varsity soccer and ran track, and I was also in both the marching band, concert band, and orchestra ensembles. I still announce at Caribou High School sporting events today, and I am now a subsitiute teacher as needed during school breaks.</p>
          <p>This website is for you to get to know me, and all that I can do. I have a passion for video production, directing, and storytelling that encompasses a range of media options. I have a never-ending thirst for adventure and enjoy trying new things as much as I do sharing the stories that come as a result of my experiences. Check out some of my work now!</p>
