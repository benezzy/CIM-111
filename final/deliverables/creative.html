  <h1>Ben Ezzy Creative Brief</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>The website is a portfolio website for me, Ben Ezzy, a junior broadcast journalism major at the University of Miami. This is an easy topic in terms of execution, because most of the media items (pictures, videos, etc.) are owned by me and already in my possession.</li><br>
    <li>I would like to use the site to organize the work I have completed over the past few years, including resume items, news stories I have written, video packages I have produced, and a documentary I worked on.</li><br>
    <li>The goal of the site is to develop it as a marketable platform to represent myself to potential employers moving forward. I want the site to encompass who I am and allow me to network with professionals in the industry while displaying the content I have produced and all of my capabilities in a polished manner.</li><br>
    <li>The audience of the site will be the potential employers and professionals in the industry that I want to view the site. They will likely see me as “just another number” in regard to applications and having work, but I want to use the site and the content within to stand out in that regard and make myself personable and attractive.</li><br>
    <li>The competition is everyone. The broadcast field is very competitive and everyone can easily produce content and call themselves a journalist, even without training. I will be competing against people like me who want to break into the industry, as well as people that are seeking new positions and have already had years in the field.</li><br>
    <li>The tone of the site needs to be professional but fun. It needs to communicate that I am hard-working and successful, while also demonstrating that I love what I do and am a passionate person.</li><br>
    <li>Basically along the same lines as the tone in #6, the message of the site is that I love what I do and am passionate about the broadcast/media field. It also needs to demonstrate that I have achieved success and am capable of producing quality content for a variety of purposes/mediums as needed.</li><br>
    <li>The visuals for the site are all created already. Since this is a portfolio, I own all of the content that I have produced and intend on displaying with the site. These will include stories I have produced with video/images, as well as a documentary I produced as part of a class.</li><br>
    <li>In terms of details, the majority of the text information will be in the form of captions on the various pieces so that there is some context and additional detail to co-exist with the work. Also, I plan on making a section of the site my resume, which will feature the information that will be relevant for potential employers.</li><br>
    <li>The site is being designed/created for CIM 111, and it will function as my final site for the semester/class. I will produce a rough draft of the site for December 5th, with the final site to be completed by December 11th.</li>
