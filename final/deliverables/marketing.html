  <h1>Ben Ezzy Marketing/SEO Plan</h1>

  <p>The marketing for the webiste will be primarily reliant on google adwords to place it in people's feeds, so that they can click on it. This is the type of thing that people need to click on and experience, not something that would necessarily benefit from visual advertisments. The content on the site itself will naturally appeal to people who are searching for freelance media producers/journalists, so the ads need to similarly attract them with those keywords (producing, directing, content, media) and the ads needs to stress the variety of my expertise. I am basing the budgetary considerations on the typical amount that my competitors will be spending, and have ballparked my spending at the lowest end of this range. This is mostly because teh site will serve as a personal marketing tool that I will distribute to people on my own, and thus most of the clicks I am looking for will be targeted by me individually and not necessarily by the google algorithms. Please see the attached breakdown of my advertisement, below.
